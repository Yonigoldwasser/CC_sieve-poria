# CC_sieve-poria
Takes the CC ratsers and the poria rasters based on their tile name and computes a masked based on poria raster and a seive command.
outputs a new raster seived and masked.

# sieve+poria_regularCC
Takes the CC ratsers and the poria rasters based on their tile name and computes a masked based on poria raster and a seive command.
outputs a new raster seived and masked - works on regular CC outputs

# sieve+poria_CropMask_regularCC
Takes the CC ratsers and the poria rasters based on their tile name and computes a masked based on poria raster and a seive command.
